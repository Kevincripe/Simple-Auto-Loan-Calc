Hello, Welcome To the Read Me for the Simple Auto Loan Calculator

This tool lets you do a stare and compare on two different sets of
auto loan data points

Annual interest rate
Number of Months
Loan amount

One can enter data in either side calculator and press the Calculate Payment button
to see the results.

valid numbers must be entered before pressing Calculate or you will receive a pop
up error.

Open scratch pad button opens up a text box for storage of notes or stats.

Open Links is screen with links to my two favorite auto purchase search websites.
